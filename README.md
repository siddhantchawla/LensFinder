# SelfieFilter

This deep learning application in python can put various types of sunglasses on a detected face by finding the Facial Keypoints (15 unique points). These keypoints mark important areas of the face - the eyes, corners of the mouth, the nose, etc.


This [dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data) to train a normal CNN model to predict the facial keypoints given a face and used the keypoints to place the desired filters on the detected face.
